# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview and purpose of Project

My task for this project was to create a summary DataFrame of ride sharing data by city type. With that data I will us Matplotlib to create a line graph showing total weekly fares for for each city type. 


## Results

It is not a surprise to see that Urban city types are higher in total fares. Urban areas historically have a higher population, therefore there will be more drivers needed to accomodate. Urban drivers equate to 5 times more drivers when compared to Suburban drivers. Rural cities having the least population amount correlates well with how they are shown on the graph. There are nearly 5 times more Suburban drivers then rural drivers. THat said, the average fare per driver in rural areas is around $25 higher when compared to Suburban and nearly $30 higher compared to Urban average fare per driver. 

As you can see from the image below, Urban areas had the highest fare followed by Suburban cities. Rural remained the lowest of the bunch. We can also see that there was  a dramatic downspike in APril for for Urban and Suburban areas while Rural cities hardly had a change.

## Summary
If the fare price was adjusted slighty for Urban and Suburban rides we would see a great increase. 

We need to do an analysis on if there aren't enough drivers in rural areas. If the demand is high, we need to employee more drivers. 

Another way to go about changing things up is to take half of your Suburban drivers and test out what the return would look like if they went to Rural cities. With the current averages we have, we would show a net increase of around $10K profit for total fares.

I need to take a deeper dive to evaluate as to why exactly April is showing such a downward spike. My assumption is that many people are enjoying spring break out of these areas.
